//Install hashcat. In my case, it is already installed in KaliLinux.
//Downloading a file with a huge number of passwords for selection: https://crackstation.net/crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm 
//And you can use: wget https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt
//We ask the admin or yourself ;) to completely copy the etc / shadow file into a separate .txt
//Create a file for the report - "report1.txt"
//Run the command in the directory where our files are located:

sudo hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 -o /home/test/Desktop/report1.txt --outfile-format 2 --show --username hashes_server.txt wordlist.txt

// -m 1800 = is the choice of encryption. In my case Centos has SHA512, which is 1800. You can use the "help" command to clarify if you need other hashes
// -a 0 = This is an attack method. 0 - with dictionary.
// -o = the path where the file for the report is located.
// --show --username = flags that should be placed before the file with hashes. It is needed in order to show in the report to which user this password was selected.
// hashes_server.txt = password hash file. Example: test1:$6$EApOxQC9$z1J5tlirhNuEuf2WU.2/SFO4hxAsySvEZWcZ/jDM7WBjLGRJmGfaJw2ixrHkM5hQKtYrpoWh2vEpZxhm3nkL.1:19485:0:99999:7:::
// report1.txt = report file. Output example: test1:1234 (Where test1 is the user and 1234 is the password)
// wordlist.txt = dictionary file (will iterate over these words).

//!!!!! Hashcat by default, it will not compare hashes that have already been generated. To do this, you need to use the flag: --potfile-disable. Or delete the potfile.
//!!!!! The --potfile-disable flag will not work with the --show flag. be careful
